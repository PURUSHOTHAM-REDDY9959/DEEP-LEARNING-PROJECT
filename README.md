# Image Classification with CNN (TensorFlow)

## Description:

This project is an implementation of an image classification model using deep learning techniques. The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow and trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to classify images into one of ten categories such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more.

This project demonstrates a complete deep learning workflow ‚Äî from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and visualization ‚Äî in a clean, modular, and reproducible way. It is implemented in Python using VS Code as the development environment and TensorFlow/Keras as the deep learning framework.
This project presents a complete deep learning pipeline for image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented in TensorFlow. The goal is to classify images into predefined categories accurately by training a model on a labeled dataset. Deep learning, especially CNNs, has proven to be highly effective for image recognition tasks due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images.

It also demonstrates how to preprocess image data, build a robust CNN model, train and validate it using real-world image data, evaluate its performance, and visualize its predictions. The trained model is also saved, enabling future inference and deployment in real applications or APIs.

# üéØ Project Objectives
Understand and implement the key steps involved in building a deep learning model for image classification.

Learn how to load, preprocess, and normalize image datasets using TensorFlow utilities.

Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras' Sequential API.

Fine-tune the model to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting using regularization and dropout.

Evaluate model performance using accuracy and loss metrics on both training and validation data.

Visualize the training process and the model‚Äôs predictions on test images.

Save the trained model for reuse and potential deployment in applications.

# üß± Dataset
The project uses the Fashion MNIST dataset (or any similar structured dataset of your choice). This dataset contains grayscale images of 10 different clothing items, such as shirts, trousers, shoes, etc. Each image is 28x28 pixels and has a corresponding label. The dataset is already divided into training and testing sets, which simplifies model development and evaluation.

# üõ†Ô∏è Model Architecture
We use a Sequential CNN model, which consists of the following layers:

Conv2D: Applies convolution with 32 filters and a 3x3 kernel, followed by ReLU activation.

MaxPooling2D: Reduces spatial dimensions using 2x2 pooling.

Conv2D: Applies 64 filters with ReLU activation.

MaxPooling2D: Further reduces spatial dimensions.

Conv2D: Another layer with 64 filters.

Flatten: Converts the 3D output into a 1D vector.

Dense Layer: Fully connected layer with 64 units and ReLU activation.

Output Layer: Dense layer with 10 units (one per class) using softmax for classification.

This architecture balances depth and simplicity, making it ideal for learning and experimentation.

# üöÄ Training and Evaluation
The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy as the loss function. The model is trained for a number of epochs, typically between 10 and 20, depending on accuracy and overfitting tendencies.

During training, the model's accuracy and loss are recorded for both training and validation datasets. These are later visualized to understand the learning trends and diagnose any issues like overfitting.

# üíæ Saving the Model
Once the training is complete and the model performs satisfactorily on the test data, it is saved using TensorFlow‚Äôs model.save() function. This creates a reusable .h5 or SavedModel format that can be loaded later for inference without retraining.

# üìà Visualizations
The training history is visualized using Matplotlib to display accuracy and loss curves over epochs. Sample test predictions are also shown using image grids, where each image is labeled with both the true and predicted class, allowing for quick visual evaluation.

# üß™ Future Enhancements
Add data augmentation to improve generalization.

Implement model checkpointing and early stopping.

Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI to build a web interface for live predictions.

Experiment with transfer learning using pretrained models like MobileNet or ResNet.

# üßæ Conclusion
This project is a hands-on example of how to develop a deep learning model for image classification from start to finish. It emphasizes good practices such as data preprocessing, structured model building, evaluation through metrics and visuals, and model saving for deployment. By following this project, one can gain practical experience in applying CNNs using TensorFlow and prepare for more advanced deep learning applications.
## üíæ Model Saving:
The trained model is saved in the HDF5 format as `cnn_model.h5`, allowing easy reuse or deployment in applications without retraining.
model.save("cnn_model.h5")
