# ðŸ§  Deep Learning Project: 

# Image Classification with CNN (TensorFlow)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is an implementation of an image classification model using deep learning techniques. The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow and trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to classify images into one of ten categories such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more.

This project demonstrates a complete deep learning workflow â€” from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and visualization â€” in a clean, modular, and reproducible way. It is implemented in Python using VS Code as the development environment and TensorFlow/Keras as the deep learning framework.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

- Understand the process of training a deep learning model using CNN.
- Learn how to preprocess image data and normalize inputs.
- Implement and fine-tune a deep neural network using TensorFlow.
- Evaluate the model on unseen test data.
- Visualize training performance and prediction results.
- Save the trained model for future inference or deployment.

## ðŸ“š Dataset

 **CIFAR-10** dataset  contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is a widely used benchmark dataset for image classification.

Classes:
- airplane,automobile,bird,cat,deer,dog,frog,horse,ship,truck.

The dataset is automatically downloaded using `tensorflow.keras.datasets`.
